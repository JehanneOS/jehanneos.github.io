title: Jehanne Operating System
public: true

Jehanne is a new distributed operating system designed for programmers.  
The core values that lead the development are [simplicity][simplicity] and security.  

Jehanne is a fork of [Harvey][harvey] (which in turn is a fork of 
[Plan 9 from Bell Labs][plan9] merged with [Nix][nix]'s kernel sources) but
diverges from the design and conventions of its ancestors whenever
they are at odds with its goals.

For this reason the project is named after the famous French heretic [Joan of Arc][arc].
