			<h1>Jehanne Operating System</h1>

<!--
			<div class="warning">
				Just like Jehanne, this design document is a work in progress.
			</div>
-->
			<p>
				Jehanne is a <b>simple</b> operating system.<br/><br/>
				It shows that few orthogonal abstractions can be composed to provide
				everything you want from modern operating systems.<br/>
				And more.<br/><br/>

			<h2>A vision for simplicity</h2>
			<p>
				Jehanne is named after a peasant girl that was burned as an heretic and then canonized as a saint.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everybody can see why it's an heretic OS: it breaks many traditions of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, it challenges some
				design decisions and even breaks some common conventions rooted in Unix.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no <code>/bin</code> folder. There is no <code>sleep</code> system call.<br/>
				There is no swap. Markdown replaces <code>troff</code> for documentation.<br/>
				GCC is the default compiler. 9P2000 is still supported, but replaced.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the point of this research is not to disrupt well established habits, but to pursuit a vision for
				<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/" target="_blank">simplicity</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beware, there's no glory for simplicity: everybody can do it,
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus#Source_of_the_story">after</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>More with less</h2>
			<p>
				Jehanne is simple in many different ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				The kernel API is minimal and uniform: 26 system calls control devices, memory, IPC, scheduling and namespaces.<br/>
				Everthing is a file. Really. Even directories.<br/>
				The default file system provides a clean taxonomy.<br/>
				The project scope includes a minimal system: compilers, editors, browsers, games...
				many useful softwares can be ported to Jehanne through
				<a href="https://github.com/JehanneOS/jehanne/tree/master/sys/src/lib/posix" target="_blank">libposix</a> and
				<a href="https://github.com/JehanneOS/newlib" target="_blank">newlib</a> (and soon musl).<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, Jehanne is free software. And it will always be.<br/>
				The kernel and older tools are GPLv2, everything new is AGPLv3.<br/>
				It's not only "formally" open, like many other projects from big names:
				you are wellcome to challenge my assumptions, prove I'm wrong, even remove my code.
			</p>
			<p>
				You just have to make it both <b>simpler</b> and <b>more useful</b>.
